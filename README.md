# Simple service to push UP commands to Uptime Kuma.

**PRs for features welcome, i only implemented necessary features for myself.**

### Possible features that would be useful but i havent had the time to implement:

- Allow background thread to receive messages and up/down statues and other customizability
- Feature to replace curl CMD with ureq or reqwest
